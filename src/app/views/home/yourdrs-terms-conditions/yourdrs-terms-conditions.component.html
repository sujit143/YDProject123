                not to provide any healthcare or medical advice or diagnosis and hence YourDrs and its Partners are not
                responsible for any medical or other outcomes between you and the medical service providers you interact
                with, pursuant to any interactions on the Website or App. If you decide to engage with a medical service
                provider to provide medical services to you, you do so at your own risk. YourDrs or its Partners shall
                not be responsible for any breach of service or service deficiency by any medical service provider you
