                            <li style="text-align: justify;">YourDrs may require the User to pay with a credit card,
                                debit card, net banking or other online payment mechanisms for Services for which an
                                amount(s) is/are payable. YourDrs will collect such User’s credit card number and/or
                                other financial institution information such as bank account numbers and will use that
                                information for the billing and payment processes, including but not limited to the use
                                and disclosure of such credit card number and information to third parties as necessary
                                to complete such billing operation. Verification of credit information, however, is
                                accomplished solely by the User through the authentication process offered by a third
                                party payment gateway. User’s credit-card/debit card details are transacted upon secure
                                sites of approved payment gateways which are digitally under encryption, thereby
                                providing the highest possible degree of care as per current technology. User is
                                advised, however, that internet technology is not full proof safe and User should
                                exercise discretion on using the same.</li>

                            inadvertently use the internet or the mobile application.</p>
